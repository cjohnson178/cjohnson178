### Nice to meet you, I'm Christopher!

I'm an Applied Mathematics student at Texas A&M (Spring '24!) with a minor in Computer Science. I've spent most of my degree contributing to industry products in my internships,
as well as working on exciting Machine Learning / Quantun Computing research at Texas A&M. As a Math Major, I have a passion for finding cutting edge computational solutions to real world
problems, ranging from GPU Algorithms I've worked on professionally for image recognition to modeling the behavior of supercapacitors using Explainable AI in my research. 

I'm currently working on a web application and an iOS app in order to explore other ways software can solve day to day problems.
